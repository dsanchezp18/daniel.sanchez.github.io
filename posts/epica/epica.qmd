On June 5th, 2003, dutch-based symphonic metal band [Epica](https://www.epica.nl/home) released their first full-length album, [*The Phantom Agony*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5qBmY4zyWEYP8bNJsq9Xjf?si=fJdSpTbvT4STnJJf3FweTw), the first of eight albums on the band's successful trajectory in the metal scene. Twenty years after, Epica is alive and kicking after having released a full-length album in 2021, [*Omega*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Hb5cbP4Z9H9G1HavAra4q?si=9oHGzf-CRferS5kk9cxbsA), an EP in 2022, [*The Alchemy Project*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5So2cOEFCkkxZ7o5DAvpPH?si=5NCuejwaT3CIfHz1qzAG-w), and were headliners of Metallica's M72 2023 World Tour concerts in Europe. Epica's lengthy trajectory and activeness make the band a great case study about death/symphonic metal has adapted to the modern stream-based music industry. In this post, yours truly uses API data from Genius, Last.fm and Spotify to look at the empirics behind Epica's discography, with an emphasis on *The Phantom Agony*.

## What makes Epica different?

Epica is *unique*. Though that is something that any die-hard fan will tell you about their favourite band, Epica has several differencing factors which make them stand out in the genre. The band combines gutural growls from death metal with soprano vocals and string orchestras. This notable musical style was first heard in *The Phantom Agony*, after Dutch guitarist and singer Mark Jansen left After Forever and founded Epica with dutch singer Simone Simons.

To look at how Epica has constructed its musical features, we can use Spotify-calculated audio features, which rank songs based on energy, danceability, valence, among others [@duman2022]. The Spotify API can be accessed with R through the [*spotifyr*](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) package, but it needs users to create a [Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/) and request a Client ID and a Client Secret. For a comprehensive tutorial on how to do this, see this [tutorial](https://msmith7161.github.io/what-is-speechiness/).

Once having acquired the credentials, set them up as system environment variables through a call to `Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'something')` and `Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET= 'something')`. Having these as system variables make the code less clunky and faster. Further, since we're going to access data from Epica, it's useful to set up the Spotify identificator for the band, which can be found in the Spotify [artist's link](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5HA5aLY3jJV7eimXWkRBBp?si=7BH2xg27Q9-gjo7UC25-FA), after the `artist/` and before the interrogation sign `?`. With that, we can acquire all albums from Epica available in Spotify, as well as audio metrics per track. The data requires quite a bit of preparation for *ggplot2* graphics, but trust me, it's worth it. Below, I acquire track-level audio metrics and then group at the album level[^1] by taking averages of all metrics.

[^1]: I only consider Epica's eight full-length releases: *The Phantom Agony (2003)*, *Consign To Oblivion (2005)*, *The Divine Conspiracy (2007)*, *Design Your Universe (2009)*, *Requiem for the Indifferent (2012)*, *The Quantum Enigma (2014)*, *The Holographic Principle (2016)*, *Omega (2021)* and their two EPs, *The Solace System (2017)* and *The Alchemy Project (2022)*. I leave out the *Attack on Titan* cover album (which does not make *Crimson Bow and Arrow* any less epic), singles and live albums.

Epica's characteristic sound, which meddles the armonious verses by the female lead with violent male growls was born in a single, *Cry for the Moon* released 2003 and also included in their first album. *Cry for the Moon* remains as one of Epica's most important tracks, as it set the scene for the what was to come later. Curiously, this first album is not the most instrumental of them all, ranking fourth in terms of instrumentalness. The most instrumental release by Epica is actually *Consign to Oblivion* (2005), often considered as the band's *magnum opus*, followed by 2016's *The Holographic Principle*. The data also shows an apparent trade-off between energy and instrumentality, an intuitive idea which is only challenged by the unique *Design Your Universe* (2009) with both high instrumentality and energy, which in my view marked the difference between the modern and the *classical* Epica. This last release contained the unforgettable *Unleashed*, probably Epica's most mainstream track so far.

Somewhat of a pattern can be found in the band's last two releases: the instrumentality fades, apparently in favour of more energy. Is this the way that Epica makes its way into today's hyper competitive and commercial music industry? A question like this has no clear answer (and perhaps does not deserve one), but the strategy here might be one of making a subtle impact. With newer releases which are *friendler* to the unexperienced listeners, Epica subtly enters the scene to the create an *obsessive devotion* after the innocent streamer turns to mindless fanatic after listening to the band's more loyal records of old.

# An attempt at stream analysis with Last.fm scrobbles

What comes to one's mind when reading about music data analysis it is easy to automatically jump towards streams. With today's stream-based music industry, data on music preferences must be infinitely better than whatever it used to be some decades ago. However, two problems arise with stream data. The first and most mundane is that *stream data is not easily accesible*, probably due to the proprietary nature of the platforms that collect such data (and perhaps its business value?). The second and more *metaphysical* issue with stream analysis is that, even though I am not a professional musician myself, I am pretty sure that no serious artist writes their music based on data (and they shouldn't). If you're not going to see Mark Jansen and Simone Simons sit down in front of a double screen display to look at a Power BI dashboard, why bother with all this?

My answer is *because we can*, or at least because there's an attempt to be made, and it aids the non-professional musician's understanding of the world of music. And while you won't see Mark Jansen trying to deploy a dockerised Shiny app, you *will* see him sitting down reading scientific literature to write lyrics [@metal-exposure2021]. Epica's inspiration on scientific knowledge for their lyrics allows for a scientific approach when trying to understand their music. As a student of social science, using data to understand the world is my best attempt at such type of knowledge.

Having that in mind, in this section I present an attempt at stream analysis with publicly available stream data from Last.fm. Last.fm is an online platform which tracks data from users through scrobbling, a way to "scrape" the data from music platforms and native media players and upload it to the user's Last.fm account. A listener, whoever, needs to self-select into creating a Last.fm account and connecting their streaming websites or computer's native media players to Last.fm. This data becomes publicly available to compute recommendations and compatibility analyses for the users. While it certainly leaves out an important chunk of the population: all of those who don't use Last.fm, which might create significant selection bias, this is better than nothing at all.

By using the [*lastfmR*](package) from Piotr Patrzyk^[Run `remotes::install_github("ppatrzyk/lastfmR")` in the console and you will access the package easily enough.], which connects to the last.fm API, I can pull data from all Last.fm users who have scrobbled Epica.

title: "Research"
---

I'm interested in causal inference, the economics of corruption, financial economics as well as in labor and education economics. However, any research question that I find interesting is worth pursuing for me. I believe that research should be as reproducible as possible, so I try to always publish my source code for all my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dsanchezp18) and [RPubs](https://github.com/dsanchezp18) sites. Further, along with the other exceptional academics at LIDE, I work on research and projects that can help the development of my home country, Ecuador. Some of the work that I've done with LIDE can be seen below or also at the organization's blog, [El Quantificador](https://elquantificador.org/).

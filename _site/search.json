I will be attending Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada for my MA studies in Fall 2022. As put by @Ego_Ipse, R is my copilot - I became passionate about data analysis and visualization using R during my undergraduate studies in econometrics, and I’ve been using R as much as I can ever since."

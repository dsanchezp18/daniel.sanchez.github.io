    "text": "I was born and raised in Quito, Ecuador, where I attended Universidad San Francisco de Quito for my undergraduate degrees. I will be attending Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada for my MA studies in Fall 2022. As put by Professor Daniel M. Giménez, R is my copilot - I became passionate about data analysis and visualization using R during my undergraduate studies in econometrics, and I’ve been using R as much as I can ever since. Although I love R, what originally got me into computing and technology was LaTeX, which is weird, I know, but it helped me pick up R and other software without much difficulty later on. I’m also passionate about teaching, which is why I started a Resources subpage in this website which may help a beginner get into R. I plan to expand this into new fields in the future.\nApart from my work and research, I love literature, memes, playing videogames and trying new foods. I’m particularly fond of Ernesto Sábato’s books and videogames from Bethesda, Fallout 3 and 4 being my personal favorites. I’m not sure about my favorite food- maybe it’s poutine, but check back later."

    "text": "On building descriptive statistic and regression tables\nThe stargazer package is one of the most time-efficient ways of constructing summary tables in R. You only need to install and load the package into your file, then use the stargazer() function with a data frame or model object. With data, it can print a fairly decent descriptive statistics table. There are additional ways to customize the function’s output (remember you can use ? before the function’s call to see the function’s documentation on RStudio’s Help pane). It can print side-by-side regressions tables by feeding a list of regressions to the functions too. The package can output the tables to LaTeX, html or text. The stargazer() function is also compatible with many different types of model objects.\nHowever, this package is not the ultimate solution for building regression tables. It quickly becomes clumsy when trying to add special types of standard errors to your estimated model coefficients, when you’re trying to add new goodness-of-fit statistics, etc. I’ve also found out that it does not work too well when used with .Rnw and .Rmd files. Below, I will talk about the great package modelsummary, however, I still believe that stargazer is a good alternative when you’re starting out, for quickly visualizing models and descriptive statistics for your data.\nmodelsummary is the ultimate alternative to stargazer. I used this package extensively in my undergraduate capstone project and found it to be amazing. It can support virtually all R model objects and allows endless customizations for your tables. One amazing feature is that you can pass arguments to the modelsummary function which work with the kable package, which are particularly useful for complex tables. One example is the longtable = T argument, which isn’t a built-in argument of modelsummary, but it is an argument for the kable package. Also, this package works perfectly with .Rnw and .Rmd files. modelsummary is very, very recommended and will probably save you time in the long run if you start using this one instead of stargazer when you start to create tables from R output. If you want guidance on how to use the package, you can check out all the vignettes made by the package author and the way that I used the package in my papers, all available in my GitHub profile."

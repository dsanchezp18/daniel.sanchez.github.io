## Bio

I was born and raised in Quito, Ecuador, where I attended Universidad San Francisco de Quito for my undergraduate degrees. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Economics in December 2021 and my Bachelor of Arts in Finance in May 2022. Currently I am attending Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada for my MA in Economics, and I am a co-op students at Natural Resources Canada. I participate as a Research Associate at [Laboratorio de Investigación para el Desarrollo del Ecuador (LIDE)](https://laboratoriolide.org/)[^1], an Ecuadorian research nonprofit whose aim is to produce and diffuse research which can help create and promote effective public policy.

As put by [Professor Daniel M. Giménez](https://twitter.com/Ego_Ipse), R is my copilot - I became passionate about data analysis and visualization using R during my undergraduate studies in econometrics, and I've been using R as much as I can ever since.

I'm also passionate about teaching, which is why I started a [Resources](resources.qmd) subpage in this website which may help a beginner get into R. I plan to expand this for new tools and fields in the future.

Apart from my work and research, I love literature, memes, playing videogames and trying new foods. I'm particularly fond of Ernesto Sábato's books and videogames from Bethesda, Fallout 3 and 4 being my personal favorites. I'm not sure about my favorite food- maybe it's poutine, but check back later.

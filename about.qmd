I was born and raised in Quito, Ecuador, where I attended Universidad San Francisco de Quito for my undergraduate degrees. I will be attending Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada for my MA studies in Fall 2022. I also work as a Data Analyst at Milmoh, S.L. and I participate as a Research Associate at Laboratorio de Investigación para el Desarrollo del Ecuador (LIDE)[^1], an Ecuadorian NGO whose aim is to produce and diffuse research which can help create and promote effective public policy.

[^1]: In English, Research Laboratory for the Development of Ecuador.

As put by [Professor Daniel M. Giménez](https://twitter.com/Ego_Ipse), R is my copilot - I became passionate about data analysis and visualization using R during my undergraduate studies in econometrics, and I've been using R as much as I can ever since. Although I love R, what originally got me into computing and technology was LaTeX, which is weird, I know, but it helped me pick up R and other software without much difficulty later on. I'm also passionate about teaching, which is why I started a [Resources](resources.qmd) subpage in this website which may help a beginner get into R. I plan to expand this into new fields in the future.

Apart from my work and research, I love literature, memes, playing videogames and trying new foods. I'm particularly fond of Ernesto Sábato's books and videogames from Bethesda, Fallout 3 and 4 being my personal favorites. I'm not sure about my favorite food- maybe it's poutine, but check back later.

<!-- As put by [Professor Daniel M. Giménez](https://twitter.com/Ego_Ipse), *R is my copilot* - I became passionate about data analysis and visualization using R during my undergraduate studies in econometrics. R was my gateway into data analytics, getting me into Python, SQL and BI tools like Tableau and Power BI.  -->
:::

<!-- I'm also passionate about teaching, which is why I started a [Resources](resources.qmd) subpage in this website which may help a beginner get into R. I plan to expand this for new tools and fields in the future. -->

<!-- Apart from my work and research, I love literature, memes, playing videogames and trying new foods. I'm particularly fond of Ernesto Sábato's books and videogames from Bethesda, Fallout 3 and 4 being my personal favourites. -->

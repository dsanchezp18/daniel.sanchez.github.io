Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Daniel Sánchez Pazmiño and I currently am a Master of Arts student at Simon Fraser University's Department of Economics. I am also a Data Analyst at Milmoh and a Research Associate at [Laboratorio de Investigación para el Desarrollo del Ecuador (LIDE)](https://laboratoriolide.org/), an Ecuadorian research nonprofit.

In this webpage, you will find [short](files/cv/daniel_sanchez_cv_shorter.pdf) and [long](files/cv/daniel_sanchez_cv.pdf) versions of my CV as well as some more information about myself and the projects I'm working on. I also sometimes write about economics, politics and other stuff in the [Posts](posts_home.qmd) page.
